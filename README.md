# Ubuntu software installers

Collection of scripts for installing common things on ubuntu. Uses instructions
from websites of each tool for 3rd party things. Current as of 30-12-2021.

From a clean ubuntu install the desktop apps script could be executed by running
the following in a terminal:

```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install curl
curl -sSf https://raw.githubusercontent.com/simonbowly/ubuntu-install/main/desktop-applications.sh | bash
```

But it's probably better to do cut and paste if you are not sure you want to
install everything or are new to this :-)
